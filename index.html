        <h3 id="tribute-info">Lebron's Biggest Moments</h2>
        <h4><br>Born in Akron, Ohio</h4>
        <p>Born December 30th, 1984, Lebron James was born to Gloria Marie James, who was 16 at the time. Throughout his childhood, James endured many struggles as his family moved from house to house and his mom struggled to find work. After finding a love for basketball with a local youth coach, Lebron began to play organized basketball for the first time. 
        <h4><br>Shows out in High School</h4>
        <p>Lebron begins to dominate as freshman in High School. Averaging 21 points and 6 rebounds a game got him the attention of many scouts. He was being thrust into the spotlight at a young age, and for good reason. He was featured in multiple magazines and being lauded by writer Ryan Jones as "the best high school basketball player right now. He would go on to win three division titles in four years.</p>
        <h4><br>Drafted into the NBA</h4>
        <p>During the 2003 draft, Lebron received the most outrageous hype that any rookie that had declared for the draft had received. He was being donned as the next Michael Jordan. With the first overall pick, the Cleveland Cavaliers drafted Lebron James.<br><br>Lebron began his first season by exceeding the hype and averaging 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists. AS A 19 YEAR OLD. For the next 10 years, he would drag awful teams to successful season after sucessful season. These incompetent front office would leave an impact on Lebron, as in 2010 he made a decision that would rock the NBA to its core.</p>
        <h4><br>The Decision</h4>
        <p>Lebron, for the first time, was a unrestricted free agent. This meant that he could go to whichever team he so choosesd. To reveal whom he had selected, Lebron hosted a 1 hour special on ESPN named "The Decision." He revealed that he was going to the Miami Heat at the end of the special. He would form a superteam with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.<br><br>To say there was outrage would be understating the public's reaction. Lebron's jerseys were being burned online and he was being booed everytime he entered into an opposing team's arena. Then, to prove the haters right, he choked during the 2011 finals and lost to the Dallas Mavericks and Dirk Nowitzki in 6. However, this loss humbled Lebron and next year he came out guns blazing.<br><br>For his remaining time in Miami, Lebron would win two championships and lose against the Spurs in 2014.</p>
        <h4><br>The Return</h4>
        <p>After the loss to the Spurs in 2014, Lebron still had not resigned to the Miami Heat. Thus speculation began to circle about which team Lebron might go to. Then, James told Sports Illustrated "My relationship with Northeast Ohio is bigger than basketball. I didn’t realize that four years ago. I do now." With that, he joined forces with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love and began a new superteam.<br><br>Against his first finals opponent, the Golden State Warriors, Lebron was alone. His running mates Kyrie and Kevin were injured and James had to face the juggernaut Warriors alone. While he put up great stats, it was not enough as the Warriors won in 6. Still, James put up such a great preformance that he was being considered for Finals MVP even though he was on the losing team.<br><br>The next season, James made it back to the finals and faced off against a familiar opponent, the Warriors. The Warriors showed their dominance early, taking a 3-1 lead. Lebron was in a position that no team in the Finals had ever come from. Still, Lebron was not willing to give up. He would lead the Cavaliers back from down 3-1 to beat the Warriors in 7 and claim Finals MVP. Lebron had cemented his legacy as one of the greatest to ever lace 'em up.<br><br>The next two years however, would be wasted as the Warriors would be powered up with the addition of Kevin Durant. Lebron would go into 2019 sore from a 4-0 finals loss.</p>
        <h4><br>The Decision 2.0</h4>
        <p>After an embarrasing loss in 2018, Lebron had enough. Shocking everyone around the NBA, Lebron decided to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers. He would be joining their young core in Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, and Josh Hart. Their first season was disaster. Lebron missed the playoffs after being hurt most of the season and the young guys had not made much progress. Something in New Orleans was brewing, however, as superstar Anthony Davis had requested a trade from the Pelicans directly to the Lakers. After much haggling, the Lakers managed to acquire Davis from the Pelicans. Rob Pelinka, the GM, made some more odd signings and went into the 2020 season a team full of hardened veterans.</p>
        <h4><br>For Kobe</h4>
        <p>The year started out amazingly for the Lebron. Going into the New Year, the Lakers had a record 26-7, by far the best in the NBA. Things were looking up for the team. Then, tragedy struck.<br><br>Kobe Bryant, one of the greatest players to play in the NBA and arguably the greatest Laker ever, had died in a helicopter accident. The casualities reached 9 people. This devasted the whole NBA, and a game against the LA Clippers had to be cancelled to give some rest to the players. For the rest of the season, the Laker players gained an extra motivation, to win the championship for Kobe. But then, another tragedy struck. A pandemic had begun to grip the nation and the NBA was forced to suspend the season. Fortunately, the NBA was able to make a deal with Disney to continue the NBA Playoffs in Disney Land. This would be an environment with no crowds, solely you and the opponent in front of you.<br><br>The Lakers entered the bubble looking rusty, going 3-5 in the regular season in the bubble. However, once the playoffs started, the Lakers became a different beast. They won each of their series in convinving fashion and ended up against Jimmy Butler and the Miami Heat. Despite choke jobs from some of Lebron's teammates, he was able to pull out a championship and win his 4th ring. He won Finals MVP and solidified his case for the GOAT even more. Lebron became the first player in NBA history to win a Finals MVP with three different teams.</p>
        <p class="quote"><br>"At that moment, I was like, ‘I’m the greatest basketball player people have ever seen, in all facets. I can play the one through five; I can guard one through five. Did something that’s never been done in the history of the sport. Teams that go down 3-1 were 0 for like 32 in Finals history. There’s nobody ever coming out of that. And nobody gave us a chance. I just felt like, ‘Ain’t nobody better than me at this.’"</p>
